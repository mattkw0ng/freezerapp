# Freezerapp
A web application that was made for organizing 'freezers' which stored various samples.

It was designed to allow one to easily edit and move these samples around while keeping a log of these changes

Included in this app:
- python flask backend server that stores and edits the data from the freezers
- 'templates' or HTML pages to form the front end of this application
- various CSS and JS files that add functionality to the front end
